        <h1> Egyptian antiquities</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The department houses over 50,000 objects, including artifacts from Nile civilizations dating from 4000 BC to the 4th century AD. The collection, among the largest in the world, provides an overview of Egyptian life in ancient Egypt, the Middle Kingdom, the New Kingdom, Coptic art, Egypt (a Roman province), the Ptolemaic Kingdom, and the Byzantine Empire. The department’s origins lie in the royal collection, but it was enhanced by Napoleon’s 1798 expedition with Dominique Vivant, future director of the Louvre. After Jean-François Champollion translated the Rosetta Stone, Charles X decreed the creation of a department of Egyptian antiquities. Champollion advised the purchase of three collections, formed by Edmé-Antoine Durand, Henri Soult, and Bernardino Drouvet. These additions added 7,000 works.</p>
